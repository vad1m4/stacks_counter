# Description
This is just an old script of mine that I created to count bulding materials for minecraft.
It converts a full number into stacks + leftovers with a database so that your list of items doesn't disappear afte you close the app.
# How to use
Pretty straightforward, load up your main.py and type in something like "100 wooden planks" to get a result of "64 + 36 Wooden Planks"
